# ubuntu-system-tools (private)

Personal system-management tooling for Ubuntu (DevOps flight-controller style).
Paranoid defaults. Micro-step operations. Logs go to tower/logs (not tracked).

## Layout
- bin/      user commands (e.g. who-uses, samsession, samsoff, ...)
- docs/     procedures / notes
- examples/ sample outputs / sanitized logs

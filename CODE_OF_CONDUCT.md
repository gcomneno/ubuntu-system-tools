# Code of Conduct
This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.

## Scope

individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

through GitHub (preferred).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
